    abstract = {ABSTRACT Although researchers now recognize that Indigenous knowledge can strengthen environmental planning and assessment, little research has empirically demonstrated how to bring together Indigenous knowledge and Western science to form a more complete picture of social-ecological change. This study attempts to fill this gap by using ‘two-eyed seeing’ – an approach that brings together Indigenous and Western perspectives on an equal basis – to collect and analyze changes in the Saskatchewan River Delta since upstream dams were built in the 1960s. Results found corroboration across the knowledge systems that operation of dams has lowered summer flows and created unnaturally high winter flows. The knowledge systems, however, diverged in some areas, such as the production of northern pike, where local residents observed abundant pike but records showed the pike commercial harvest declining to near zero. Indigenous knowledge alone provided information about berries and berry seasons. This two-eyed seeing approach can enhance environmental assessment and planning by providing a more accurate and coherent narrative of long-term social-ecological change. },

    abstract = {Climate extremes threaten human health, economic stability, and the well-being of natural and built environments (e.g., 2003 European heat wave). As the world continues to warm, climate hazards are expected to increase in frequency and intensity. The impacts of extreme events will also be more severe due to the increased exposure (growing population and development) and vulnerability (aging infrastructure) of human settlements. Climate models attribute part of the projected increases in the intensity and frequency of natural disasters to anthropogenic emissions and changes in land use and land cover. Here, we review the impacts, historical and projected changes,and theoretical research gaps of key extreme events (heat waves, droughts, wildfires, precipitation, and flooding). We also highlight the need to improve our understanding of the dependence between individual and interrelated climate extremes because anthropogenic-induced warming increases the risk of not only individual climate extremes but also compound (co-occurring) and cascading hazards. ▪  Climate hazards are expected to increase in frequency and intensity in a warming world. ▪  Anthropogenic-induced warming increases the risk of compound and cascading hazards. ▪  We need to improve our understanding of causes and drivers of compound and cascading hazards. },

This coupling is nonlinear by nature and complicated in atmospheric flows where eddies of many sizes are superimposed. In mountainous terrain, wind flow descriptions are further complicated by topographically influenced or enhanced flows. To improve the current understanding and modeling of blowing snow transport in complex terrain, statistically significant timing and frequencies of wind–snow coupling were identified in high-frequency observations of surface blowing snow and near-surface turbulence from a mountain field site in the Canadian Rockies. Investigation of the mechanisms influencing near-surface, high-frequency turbulence and snow concentration fluctuations provided strong evidence for amplitude modulation from large-scale motions. The large-scale atmospheric motions modulating near-surface turbulence and snow transport were then compared to specific quadrant analysis structures recently identif... },

    abstract = {While turbulent bursts are considered critical for blowing-snow transport and initiation, the interaction of the airflow with the snow surface is not fully understood. To better characterize the coupling of turbulent structures and blowing-snow transport, observations collected in natural environments at the necessary high-resolution time scales are needed. To address this, high-frequency measurements of turbulence, blowing-snow density and particle velocity were made in the Canadian Rockies. During blowing-snow storms, modified variable-interval time averaging enabled identification of periods of near-surface blowing-snow coupling with shear-stress-producing motions in the lowest 2 m of the atmospheric surface layer. The identification of those turbulent motions responsible for blowing snow yields a better understanding of the event-driven mechanics of initiation and sustained transport. The type of coherent structures generating the Reynolds stress are just as important as the magnitude of the Reynolds stress in initiating and sustaining near-surface blowing snow. Our results suggest that blowing-snow models driven by merely the time-averaged shear stress lack physical realism in the near-surface region. The next phase of the development of blowing-snow models should incorporate parametrizations of coherent turbulent structures. },

@article{Asong2020HighresolutionMF,
    abstract = {Abstract. Cold region hydrology is very sensitive to the impacts of climate warming.
Impacts of warming over recent decades in western Canada include glacier
retreat, permafrost thaw, and changing patterns of precipitation, with an
increased proportion of winter precipitation falling as rainfall and shorter durations of snow cover, as well as consequent changes in flow regimes. Future warming is expected to continue along these lines. Physically realistic and
sophisticated hydrological models driven by reliable climate forcing can
provide the capability to assess hydrological responses to climate change.
However, the provision of reliable forcing data remains problematic,
particularly in data-sparse regions. Hydrological processes in cold regions
involve complex phase changes and so are very sensitive to small biases in
the driving meteorology, particularly in temperature and precipitation,
including precipitation phase. Cold regions often have sparse surface
observations, particularly at high elevations that generate a large amount
of runoff. This paper aims to provide an improved set of forcing data for
large-scale hydrological models for climate change impact assessment. The
best available gridded data in Canada are from the high-resolution forecasts
of the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) atmospheric model and outputs
of the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA), but these datasets have a
short historical record. The EU WATCH ERA-Interim reanalysis (WFDEI) has a
longer historical record but has often been found to be biased relative to
observations over Canada. The aim of this study, therefore, is to blend the
strengths of both datasets (GEM-CaPA and WFDEI) to produce a less-biased
long-record product (WFDEI-GEM-CaPA) for hydrological modelling and climate
change impact assessment over the Mackenzie River Basin. First, a
multivariate generalization of the quantile mapping technique was
implemented to bias-correct WFDEI against GEM-CaPA at 3 h × 0.125 ∘ resolution during the 2005–2016 overlap period, followed by a
hindcast of WFDEI-GEM-CaPA from 1979. The derived WFDEI-GEM-CaPA data are
validated against station observations as a preliminary step to assess their
added value. This product is then used to bias-correct climate projections
from the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis Canadian
Regional Climate Model (CanRCM4) between 1950 and 2100 under RCP8.5, and an
analysis of the datasets shows that the biases in the original WFDEI product
have been removed and the climate change signals in CanRCM4 are preserved.
The resulting bias-corrected datasets are a consistent set of historical and
climate projection data suitable for large-scale modelling and future
climate scenario analysis. The final historical product (WFDEI-GEM-CaPA,
1979–2016) is freely available at the Federated Research Data Repository at
 https://doi.org/10.20383/101.0111 (Asong et al.,
2018), while the original and corrected CanRCM4 data are available at

@article{VanHuizen2019SeasonalGI,
    abstract = {Peatlands in the Western Boreal Plains act as important water sources in the landscape. Their persistence, despite potential evapotranspiration (PET) often exceeding annual precipitation, is attributed to various water storage mechanisms. One storage element that has been understudied is seasonal ground ice (SGI). This study characterized spring SGI conditions and explored its impacts on available energy, actual evapotranspiration, water table, and near surface soil moisture in a western boreal plains peatland. The majority of SGI melt took place over May 2017. Microtopography had limited impact on melt rates due to wet conditions. SGI melt released 139mm in ice water equivalent (IWE) within the top 30cm of the peat, and weak significant relationships with water table and surface moisture suggest that SGI could be important for maintaining vegetation transpiration during dry springs. Melting SGI decreased available energy causing small reductions in PET (<10mm over the melt period) and appeared to reduce actual evapotranspiration variability but not mean rates, likely due to slow melt rates. This suggests that melting SGI supplies water, allowing evapotranspiration to occur at near potential rates, but reduces the overall rate at which evapotranspiration could occur (PET). The role of SGI may help peatlands in headwater catchments act as a conveyor of water to downstream landscapes during the spring while acting as a supply of water for the peatland. Future work should investigate SGI influences on evapotranspiration under differing peatland types, wet and dry spring conditions, and if the spatial variability of SGI melt leads to spatial variability in evapotranspiration. },
